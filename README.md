This plan is to participate in the initial offering of SSE token for long-term investors, project sponsors and VC investors.

To participate in this investment plan, your investment amount must be determined within the minimum and maximum allocation range of the project pre-sale, and after that, raise your investment amount with the Slaunch team and send your request email to 

slaunch@soroosh.app

Reviewing your application will take 6 to 12 working hours, and then you can have an interview with the main project managers and ask your questions.

One of the important factors of investing in this sector is the duration of your investment according to the        time-lock smart contract. When you participate in this pre-sale to avoid being a whale in the project, your contract will be created and its ownership will be transferred to you.

Note : The time intervals of Smart Contract time-lock of Soroosh Smart Ecosystem are different in each project.
 ( Negotiable )

 In the SSE project, your tokens are released in 6-month periods, and every 6 months 8.33% of your tokens will be released, and all tokens Purchased will be released after 6 years. At each stage of the release, you can transfer the released tokens of your smart contract to your own wallet address.
